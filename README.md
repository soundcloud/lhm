# Large Hadron Migrator [![Build Status][5]][4]

Rails style database migrations are a useful way to evolve your data schema in
an agile manner. Most Rails projects start like this, and at first, making
changes is fast and easy.

That is until your tables grow to millions of records. At this point, the
locking nature of `ALTER TABLE` may take your site down for an hour or more
while critical tables are migrated. In order to avoid this, developers begin
to design around the problem by introducing join tables or moving the data
into another layer. Development gets less and less agile as tables grow and
grow. To make the problem worse, adding or changing indices to optimize data
access becomes just as difficult.

> Side effects may include black holes and universe implosion.

There are few things that can be done at the server or engine level. It is
possible to change default values in an `ALTER TABLE` without locking the
table. The InnoDB Plugin provides facilities for online index creation, which
is great if you are using this engine, but only solves half the problem.

At SoundCloud we started having migration pains quite a while ago, and after
looking around for third party solutions, we decided to create our
own. We called it Large Hadron Migrator, and it is a gem for online
ActiveRecord migrations.

## The idea

The basic idea is to perform the migration online while the system is live,
without locking the table. In contrast to [OAK][0] and the
[facebook tool][1], we only use a copy table and triggers.

The Large Hadron is a test driven Ruby solution which can easily be dropped
into an ActiveRecord migration. It presumes a single auto
incremented numerical primary key called id as per the Rails convention. Unlike
the [twitter solution][2], it does not require the presence of an indexed
`updated_at` column.

## Requirements

Lhm currently only works with MySQL databases and requires an established
ActiveRecord connection.

It is compatible and [continuously tested][4] with MRI 2.0.x, 2.1.x,
ActiveRecord 3.2.x and 4.x (mysql and mysql2 adapters).

## Limitations

Due to the Chunker implementation, Lhm requires that the table to migrate has
a single integer numeric key column called `id`.

Another note about the Chunker, it performs static sized row copies against the `id`
column.  Therefore sparse assignment of `id` can cause performance problems for the
backfills.  Typically LHM assumes that `id` is an `auto_increment` style column.

## Installation

Install it via `gem install lhm` or add `gem "lhm"` to your Gemfile.

## Usage

You can invoke Lhm directly from a plain ruby file after connecting ActiveRecord
to your mysql instance:

```ruby
require 'lhm'

ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(
  :adapter => 'mysql',
  :host => '127.0.0.1',
  :database => 'lhm'
)

# and migrate
Lhm.change_table :users do |m|
  m.add_column :arbitrary, "INT(12)"
  m.add_column :locale, "VARCHAR(2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'en'"
  m.add_index  [:arbitrary_id, :created_at]
  m.ddl("alter table %s add column flag tinyint(1)" % m.name)
end
```

To use Lhm from an ActiveRecord::Migration in a Rails project, add it to your
Gemfile, then invoke as follows:

```ruby
require 'lhm'

class MigrateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    Lhm.change_table :users do |m|
      m.add_column :arbitrary, "INT(12)"
      m.add_index  [:arbitrary_id, :created_at]
      m.ddl("alter table %s add column flag tinyint(1)" % m.name)
    end
  end

  def self.down
    Lhm.change_table :users do |m|
      m.remove_index  [:arbitrary_id, :created_at]
      m.remove_column :arbitrary
    end
  end
end
```

**Note:** Lhm won't delete the old, leftover table. This is on purpose, in order
to prevent accidental data loss.

## Throttler

Lhm is using a throttle mechanism to read data in your original table.

By default, 40000 rows are read each 0.1 second.

If you want to change that behaviour, you can pass an instance of a throttler with the `throttler` option.

In this example, 1000 rows will be read with a 10 seconds delay between each processing:
```ruby
my_throttler = Lhm::Throttler::Time.new(stride: 1000, delay: 10)

Lhm.change_table :users, throttler: my_throttler  do |m|
  #
end
```

### SlaveLag Throttler

Lhm uses by default the time throttler, however a better solution is to throttle the copy of the data
depending on the time that the slaves are behind. To use the SlaveLag throttler:
```ruby
Lhm.change_table :users, throttler: :slave_lag_throttler  do |m|
  #
end
```

Or to set that as default throttler, use the following (for instance in a Rails initializer):
```ruby
Lhm.setup_throttler(:slave_lag_throttler)
```

## Table rename strategies

There are two different table rename strategies available: LockedSwitcher and
AtomicSwitcher.

The LockedSwitcher strategy locks the table being migrated and issues two ALTER TABLE statements.
The AtomicSwitcher uses a single atomic RENAME TABLE query and is the favored solution.

Lhm chooses AtomicSwitcher if no strategy is specified, **unless** your version of MySQL is
affected by [binlog bug #39675](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=39675). If your version is
affected, Lhm will raise an error if you don't specify a strategy. You're recommended
to use the LockedSwitcher in these cases to avoid replication issues.

To specify the strategy in your migration:

```ruby
Lhm.change_table :users, :atomic_switch => true do |m|
  # ...
end
```

## Limiting the data that is migrated

For instances where you want to limit the data that is migrated to the new
table by some conditions, you may tell the migration to filter by a set of
conditions:

```ruby
Lhm.change_table(:sounds) do |m|
  m.filter("inner join users on users.`id` = sounds.`user_id` and sounds.`public` = 1")
end
```

Note that this SQL will be inserted into the copy directly after the "from"
statement - so be sure to use inner/outer join syntax and not cross joins. These
conditions will not affect the triggers, so any modifications to the table
during the run will happen on the new table as well.

## Cleaning up after an interrupted Lhm run

If an Lhm migration is interrupted, it may leave behind the temporary tables
and/or triggers used in the migration. If the migration is re-started, the
unexpected presence of these tables will cause an error.

In this case, `Lhm.cleanup` can be used to drop any orphaned Lhm temporary tables or triggers.

To see what Lhm tables/triggers are found:

```ruby
Lhm.cleanup
```

To remove any Lhm tables/triggers found:
```ruby
Lhm.cleanup(:run)
```

Optionally only remove tables up to a specific Time, if you want to retain previous migrations.

Rails:
```ruby
Lhm.cleanup(:run, until: 1.day.ago)
```

Ruby:
```ruby
Lhm.cleanup(:run, until: Time.now - 86400)
```
